## Student Profile Web Page

This repository contains the solution for **Lab Assignment – 02**, which focuses on creating a structured web page using **HTML5 semantic elements** and applying styles using **basic CSS selectors** only.

The project demonstrates correct usage of:
- Semantic HTML structure
- External CSS styling
- CSS selectors up to element, class, ID, group, descendant, and universal selectors

Advanced CSS techniques and scripting languages are strictly avoided as per lab instructions.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this lab assignment, the following objectives are achieved:

- Creating a well-structured HTML document
- Using semantic HTML elements correctly
- Applying CSS using different types of selectors
- Maintaining separation between content and presentation
- Inspecting and analyzing applied CSS using browser developer tools

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

## Implementation Details

### HTML Structure
The webpage includes the following sections:
- Header (College name and page title)
- Student Information
- Course Information
- Hobbies
- Contact Information
- Footer

Semantic HTML elements such as `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` are used throughout the document.

---

### CSS Styling
All styling is done using an **external CSS file** (`style.css`) and includes:

- **Universal Selector** – Reset default margin and padding
- **Element Selectors** – Styling headings and paragraph text
- **Class Selector** – Reusable `section-box` class for layout consistency
- **ID Selector** – Unique styling for student name
- **Group Selector** – Common styles for level-two and level-three headings
- **Descendant Selector** – Different styles for course and hobby list items

---

## Inspection and Analysis

Using the browser’s developer tools:
- An element styled using a **class selector** was identified and documented
- An element styled using an **ID selector** was identified and documented

These are clearly mentioned as **HTML comments** inside the `index.html` file.

---

## Constraints Followed

✔ No inline CSS  
✔ No internal `<style>` tags  
✔ No JavaScript  
✔ No Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries, or animations
